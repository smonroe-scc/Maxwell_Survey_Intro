Any other object that repels a glass rod is also positively charged. Any object that attracts is negatively charged.  Therefore a plastic rod rubbed with wool is negative.  "

Although this person may exist in history, the furthest back in time I was able to go was the 19th century and the person that keeps coming up over and over is Michael Faraday.  Faraday would sprinkle iorn filings onto a piece of paper, then place a bar magnet into this enviornment.  The pattern that Faraday observed is very familiar.  The pattern produced was regular, repeatable, and predictable. It seemed to Faraday that there was something going on with the actual space around the magnet.
